    <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <p>
        As an intern, your challenge is to create a web page that displays posts and comments from a backend server.
        <br />
        Follow the steps below:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Fetch all the posts from the JSON server's API.</li>
        <li>Display the posts on the web page, showing the title and content of each post.</li>
        <li>For each post, fetch and display the comments from the JSON server's API.</li>
        <li>Within each comment, display the name of the user who posted it.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Think of this challenge as creating a simplified version of Twitter, where you can view posts and their associated comments.</p>
    <p>
        It's important to prioritize the page style and design to create an appealing user experience. While knowing how to make different types of requests is valuable, focusing on the visual presentation of the page can make a significant impact. 
    </p>

        Don't feel pressured. You're expected to not know how to deal with 100% of this challenge. <br />
        One of the most valuable assets for us in this exercise is to understand your learning process and how you approach challenges when you encounter difficulties. It is important for me to know how you handle problems and what steps you take to find solutions.
